To help explain the basics of Alight Motion so we can to get you up and running making your own custom projects, we've created the following introductory series. \n Getting Started (Part One) covers adding and adjusting layers in your project, to get them ready for animation. \n \n https://youtu.be/JUDdyfYWweE \n \n Please note that depending your version of Alight Motion and your device, the menus may look slightly different, especially at the following times: \n Add Menu (1:00) - Vector and Freehand drawing are available from the main screen in newer versions of Alight Motion. \n Blending and Opacity (2:37) - We have added many more blending modes to Alight Motion, and they have been arranged into categories. Multiply is contained within Darken. Screen is contained within Lighten. Mask and Exclude are contained within Mask. \n Once you have added and adjusted your layer, it's now time to animate, which is covered in Getting Started - Part Two! \n \n https://youtu.be/e3waU-6VuY8 \n \n Now you're on your way to create more complicated projects! Please feel free to ask any questions in the comments of these videos, or any of our other tutorials on YouTube, we go through them regularly! \n ",

Creating elements that can can be altered when placed in projects significantly increases their usability. \n \n Retiming marks appear as small yellow ticks on the timeline, as seen in the image below. They are only visible when editing the element, and not when the element is placed into a project. \n read more here : \n https://support.alightcreative.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030992351-Elements-Retiming-Marks",

        "text": "What is Easing? \n \n One of the secrets to fluid-looking animation is motion that accelerates and decelerates, rather than moving at a constant rate. \n Even the world's most advanced sports car takes time to accelerate to speed. So does your hand, when you wave.\n This process of gradually speeding up and slowing down an animation is called easing. In contrast, we refer to motion at a constant rate as linear. \n read more here : https://support.alightcreative.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007063731-How-do-I-use-Animation-Easing-Curves-",

The effect has two parameters: Brightness, and Contrast. \n \n Brightness changes the overall lightness or darkness of a layer. Higher values of Brightness will make the layer approach white, while lower values will make the layer approach black.\n \n Contrast changes the separation of light and dark colors in a layer. Higher values of Contrast emphasize detail. Lower values of Contrast create a flatter look that emphasizes midtones.",

It has the following parameters: Center, Frequency, Strength, Phase, Radius, and Feather. \n \n Center changes the center of the ripple in relation to the center of the layer. \n\n Frequency changes the spacing between each individual wave. Increasing the value of Frequency will decrease the spacing between waves.\n\n Strength changes the amount of distortion caused by the waves, which higher values causing more distortion.\n\n Phase moves the waves inwards towards or outwards from the centre of the ripple. Using keyframe animation with this parameter can make it looks like the ripple is spreading out over time.\n\n Radius changes the distance from the center where the waves are cut off. \n\n Feather controls how smoothly the waves are cut off at the radius. Higher values of Feather cause a softer cutoff.",
